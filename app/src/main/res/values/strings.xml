    <string name="SponsorTxt">What is a MealPass sponsor? \n\nA MealPass sponsor is a supporter of MealPass revolutionising digital food donation platform where food retailers can donate food directly to the recipients in their local communities in collaboration with food charities. The platform targets the end-of-day-unsold food (70% of total excess food) which food charities are unable to collect and redistribute.\n\n\nWhy become MealPass sponsor?\n\nA sponsorship can go a long way for someone in need and you can make a huge difference to someone\'s life by supporting MealPass food donation platform. Together we can reduce hunger and food waste, which are 2 of the most pressing issues in the world today.\n\n\nHow to become MealPass sponsor?\n\nBecoming a sponsor of MealPass food donation platform is easy:\n\n1- You can sponsor meal donations from a specific food retailer where you decide how many daily meals you want to sponsor and for how many days. The price can vary from food retailer to food retailer.\n\nOR\n\n2- You can sponsor the hard work of expanding and implementing MealPass food donation platform in local communities all over the country where people need help. This sponsorship can be a one off or recurring.\n\nYou can pay either by credit card or bank transfer.\n\nEvery sponsor will be offered a place on our sponsors wall of fame page where your picture/company logo together with your name and city/country will be visible and is shown both on our app and our website. Please note that it is not mandatory to be placed on our wall of fame. The choice is all yours.</string>
